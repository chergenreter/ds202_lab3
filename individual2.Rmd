# From the data set, I can only interpret that the happiness levels vary if based on level of education or marital status. While there is a relatively larger number of data entries for high school or married, there appears to be a somewhat similar pattern of distribution among the different degree and marital status levels. While I believe I managed to convert the missing values to NA, tt does seem to show a small chunk of the data of people that didn't answer their happiness levels.
